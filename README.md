## Description

This project is a clone of the Airbnb web application. It's designed to be deployed on a simple server, created from scratch, and will go through different phases to mimic the functionality of Airbnb.

## Getting Started

To get started with the Airbnb Clone, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Christianib003/alu-AirBnB_clone.git
   ```

2. Ensure you have [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/) installed.
3. Navigate inside the cloned project folder

    ```bash
    cd alu-AirBnB_clone
    ```

4. Run the command interpreter using:

   ```bash
   ./console.py
   ```

   You're ready to interact with the application!

### How to Use

Once the interpreter is running, you can interact with it by typing commands at the prompt `(hbnb)`. Here are some available commands:

- `quit`: Exit the interpreter.
- `EOF`: Exit the interpreter (equivalent to `Ctrl + D`).
- `help`: To get information about the supported commands
- More commands can be added as the project progresses.

### Examples

1. Quiting the application

```bash
(hbnb) quit
$

4. More to be added.
